# NFChecker
A Python tool to analyze functional dependencies in a relational schema. It identifies candidate keys, prime and non-key attributes, and determines the highest normal form (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF). Users input attributes and functional dependencies, and the tool computes normalization details, aiding in efficient database design.
